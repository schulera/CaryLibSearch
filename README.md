Figshare API usage examples: making API calls to custom Figshare for Institutions repositories using R.

This allows institutions to create custom metadata, restrict publication of sensitive data, mint their own DOIs, and take advantage of other platform features.

The Figshare API works for both the public [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) repository as well as Figshare for Institutions instances like the [Cary Institute data repository](https://caryinstitute.figshare.com/).  

The [Figshare API documentation](https://docs.figshare.com/) is thorough and Open API compatible, however, it does not provide examples in R.
