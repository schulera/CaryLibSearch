# Figshare API in R
Pull data from your Figshare for Institutions repository into the RStudio environment.

Figshare is a public all-in-one repository for papers, data, and other research outputs.  Figshare for Institutions (FI) is a licensed product that allows institutions to set up a custom portal of Figshare, allowing institutions to mint their own DOIs, create custom metadata, restricted publishing, and other features.  

This Figshare API call leverages R, the computing environment that many life scientists use to manipulate and analyze data.
